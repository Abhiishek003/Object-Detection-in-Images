# Object Detection in Images using Deep Learning

This project demonstrates object detection in static images using pre-trained deep learning models such as YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN. Implemented on Google Colab using Python, the model identifies and localizes multiple objects in an image with bounding boxes and class labels.
